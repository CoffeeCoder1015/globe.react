# üåç Realistic Globe Renderer
This project is a **Next.js** application that renders a highly realistic 3D globe using **Three.js**.
It features **real-time daylight simulation** based on accurate sun position calculations, creating a dynamic day/night cycle that evolves continuously with the current time.

# ‚ú® Key Features

- **Accurate Real-Time Sun Positioning**  
  Calculates the sun's position based on the current time and date, enabling dynamic and realistic lighting of the globe that matches the actual daylight and shadow regions on Earth.

- **Smooth Day/Night Cycle**  
  Continuously updates the globe‚Äôs lighting to reflect the progression of time, creating natural transitions between day and night.

- **Advanced Atmospheric Rendering with Rayleigh Scattering**  
  Implements a physically-based atmosphere model that simulates Rayleigh scattering, producing natural sky colors and soft atmospheric gradients for enhanced realism.

- **Geolocation-Based Camera Positioning**  
  Utilizes the browser‚Äôs geolocation API to detect the user‚Äôs current location and automatically orient the camera to focus on that region of the globe.

- **Enhanced Open-Source Globe Simulation**  
  Builds upon existing open-source globe rendering projects by improving atmospheric effects and lighting models to achieve a more lifelike appearance.
